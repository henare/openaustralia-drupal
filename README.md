OpenAustralia.org for Drupal
============================

This is a [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) module that displays your MP's most recent speeches from [OpenAustralia.org](http://www.openaustralia.org/), similar to [oa4wp](https://github.com/henare/oa4wp).

Download the code and put it in the `sites/all/modules` directory of your Drupal 7 installation to make it available for all sites and then add the OpenAustralia block to your site.

To report bugs or request features, email the [OpenAustralia Community list](http://groups.google.com/group/openaustralia-dev/).
